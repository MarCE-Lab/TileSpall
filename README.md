# TileSpall
This dataset comprises **364 images of tile spalling on building faÃ§ades**, collected to support research on faÃ§ade damage detection and segmentation. The dataset is designed to reflect real-world variability in spalling appearance and building conditions.

## Overview

The whole data collection process aims to capture the high variability of tile spalling, involving the search for spalling images and manual annotation of spalling areas. To maintain the high variability of building and tile spalling, 90\% of the images were obtained from Google Street View, 6.5\% were captured using smartphones, and the remaining 3.5\% were sourced from various social media platforms. This collection includes all seasons in 10 cities located in Taiwan, resulting in a dataset of 364 damaged images. To facilitate clear observation of spalling representation, all images were captured from the front of buildings.

## Example Images
