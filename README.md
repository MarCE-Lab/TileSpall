# TileSpall
This dataset comprises **364 images of tile spalling on building faÃ§ades**, collected to support research on faÃ§ade damage detection and segmentation. The dataset is designed to reflect real-world variability in spalling appearance and building conditions.

## Overview

- **Images:** 364 real-world RGB images  
- **Annotations:** Pixel-wise binary masks (in PNG format)  
- **Domain:** Urban buildings with tile detachment (spalling)  
- **Geographic scope:** Multiple cities in Taiwan  

## Data Collection

To ensure diversity in spalling appearance and environmental conditions:

- **90%** of images were sourced from **Google Street View**
- **6.5%** from smartphone photography
- **3.5%** from **social media platforms**

## Examples

Below are some sample pairs of images and their corresponding binary masks:

> *Each column shows an original image (left) and its manually annotated mask (right). Spalling areas are marked in white.*
